# Boids2 
## Otherwise known as Boids take 2 

I tried again and turns out it's not that hard. 

This isn't really a game per se, just an unreal map and a couple of scripts that emulate the behavior. You can run it by just opening the .uproject and the map *should* just pop right up. If it doesn't, you can open the map from the content viewer.  

There are a few parameters attached to the BoidController object in the map, feel free to mess around with them.
