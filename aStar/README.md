# A*
## (albiet a buggy version of a*)

A lot of this is based off of the youtube tutorial in the assignment page. I tried modifying it to fit further requirements, such as adding obstacles to my implementation. 

You should just be able to open the .uproject. The map itself is generated through the tile generator blueprint, and includes configs for size, and if diagonal movement is allowed.

There is also a parameter for turning tiles into obstacles. you have to click on them in the editor and change the boolean for them there. 

Thank you for letting me try this. 
This, as work, is not up to par. It has bugs. I am aware of them. Whatever grade I get for this assignment, I won't argue with it. 

And thanks for being patient with me.
